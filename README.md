# Face_Recog_StudentAttendanceSystem

In this repository you can find the project which I have created. In this project I have created Student Attendance Management System using Face Recognition. Here in this project I have created one main file naming main.py. In this file I have imported all other files created which are required. This application is created using tkiniter. Using this application we can take photo sample of any student and train that model. And we don't have to fill manually whether the student is absent or present. Once if the student is present, it will detect its face and mark present including the time which it detected the face.


Here I have uploaded zip file and even one by one file created in this project. You can download either of it.
To use the project you have to run main file. But at first you have to install some of the libraries which are pre-requisites.

# libraries required
opencv(command- pip install cv2)
# Create the haar cascade
faceCascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cascPath)


I have taken the help of youTube videos and some of the sites to complete this project.

I recommend you to use this project for educational purpose only. Donot use for other purpose.


Please create two folders naming Images and data.

In Images folder include all the images which you want to show in your project and add the path of desired image in the file you required to show. I hope you can edit the paths of images.
Data folder is for  images which will be captured during taking photo sample.
